# **Description**
Welcome to Quadle (Inspired by Wheel of Fortune and New York Times' Wordle)

Rules:
  1. In order to win, players have to guess the 4-letter English word.
  2. Players' guesses have be letters and not the word itself.
  3. Players have five lives. Every failure to guess a letter contained in the word will result in the loss of a life.
  4. If your lives hit zero, you lose.
